Prof C is a world-renowned professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University. He is a pioneer in nanoscale science and technology, with groundbreaking contributions to the synthesis, assembly, and characterization of nanoscale materials and their applications in nanoelectronics and nanobiotechnology.

His research group has developed novel approaches for the rational synthesis of semiconductor nanowires with controlled composition, structure, and properties. These nanowire building blocks have been used to create some of the smallest electronic and optoelectronic devices, and have enabled new approaches for ultrasensitive, real-time detection of biological and chemical species.

Prof C has received numerous awards and honors for his contributions to science, including membership in the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He has published over 400 papers in peer-reviewed journals and holds more than 50 issued US patents.

His current research focuses on developing nanoscale devices and systems for applications in computing, sensing, and medicine, with particular emphasis on creating new tools for neuroscience research and brain-machine interfaces.
